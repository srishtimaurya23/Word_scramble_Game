# Word Scramble Challenge

A simple **command-line Word Scramble Game** made with Python as a VITyarthi project.

## Overview

The game selects five random words from a chosen difficulty level and scrambles their letters. The player gets three attempts for each word. A correct answer gives one point. The score is displayed after each game, and the cumulative score is displayed when the player exits.

## Features

- Easy, Medium and Hard levels
- 5 random words per game
- 3 attempts for each word
- Automatic answer checking
- Score out of 5 for each game
- Cumulative score for multiple games
- Input validation for difficulty and replay choices
- Modular Python files
- Basic validation tests

## Functional Modules

1. **Word Management** – `word_bank.py` stores words for each difficulty.
2. **Game Logic** – `game_logic.py` controls word selection, attempts, answer checking and scoring.
3. **User Interaction** – `utils.py` and `input_handler.py` handle menus and user input.
4. **Score Management** – `score_manager.py` displays game and final results.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Usability:** simple CLI prompts make the game easy to use.
- **Performance:** words are stored in memory and processed quickly.
- **Reliability:** invalid menu and replay choices are handled through validation.
- **Maintainability:** related functions are separated into modules.
- **Resource Efficiency:** only Python standard-library features are used.
- **Portability:** the program can run with Python 3.x.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- VS Code or any Python-supported editor
- Git for GitHub submission

**No external packages are required.**

## Setup & Run

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/srishtimaurya23/Word_scramble_Game.git
cd Word_scramble_Game
```

Run the game:

```bash
python main.py
```

On Windows, you can also use:

```bash
py main.py
```

## How to Play

1. Select a difficulty level.
2. A scrambled word is displayed.
3. Enter your answer.
4. You get 3 attempts for each word.
5. Five words are played in one game.
6. Check your score.
7. Choose whether to play again.

## Testing

Run:

```bash
python test_game.py
```

The tests check:
- scrambled words contain the same letters as the original word
- all three difficulty levels exist
- every level has at least five words
- replay validation accepts only `y` or `n`

A database is not used in this project, so an ER diagram is not applicable.

## Project Report

A report draft covering the VITyarthi requirements is available in [`PROJECT_REPORT.md`](PROJECT_REPORT.md). The final report can be exported to PDF for portal submission.
